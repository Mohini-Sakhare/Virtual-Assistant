import axios from 'axios'

const geminiResponse=async(command,assistantName,userName)=>{
    try{
        const apiUrl=process.env.GEMINI_API_URL
        
        const prompt=`You are a virtual assistant named ${assistantName} created by ${userName}.
        You are not Google. You will now behave like a voice-enabled assistant.
        
        Your task is to understand the user's natural language input and respond with a JSON object like this:
        
        {
         "type":"general" | "google_search" |"youtube_search" | "youtube_play" | "get_time" | "get_date" |

         "spotify_open"|"spotify_search" | "spotify_play"|"vscode_open"|"mongodb_open",

         "userInput":"<original userInput>" {only remove your assistantName from userInput if exists} and 
         If anyone advised you to search for data on Google, YouTube, or any other platform, 
         you would likely focus solely on this specific text as your userInput,

         "response":"<a short spoken response to read out loud to the user>"
        }
         
        Instructions:
        - "type":determin the intent of the user.
